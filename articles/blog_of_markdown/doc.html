<h1>Blog of Markdown</h1>

<p>Static web site built from Markdown documents using shell, make and some other
command line tools. Running <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/"><code>make</code></a> in the
repository root should update all HTML from Markdown documents.</p>

<p>The typical workflow is to store everything in <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and
push it to a web server when documents has been updated. Since everything is
static HTML it&rsquo;s very easy to review locally.</p>

<p>The blog has support for posts which are supposed to be authored once and
articles which can be revised at any time; the difference is by convention only
really. One Markdown document and (small) meta file is maintained per post or
article. See <code>posts/2019-06-30/...</code> in the
<a href="https://github.com/johan-bolmsjo/blog_of_markdown">software repository</a> for an
example.</p>
